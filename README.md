### Hi 👋, I'm Ridda Witdianti

<!--
**RiddaWitdianti/RiddaWitdianti** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- 🔭 I’m currently looking for a job and always learning to improve my programming skills
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Laravel Framework and Vu.js
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with brainstorming about the world of programming especially in the web
- 💬 Ask me anything related to web applications, especially in the field of design
- 📫 How to reach me: your own way 😉
- ⚡ Fun fact: I love coding with a dark theme and it keeps me from being distracted by my eyesight and listening to 🐈 purrs in my daily life 
-->

Thank You 😊
